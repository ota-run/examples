# Ota extension examples

Use this theme when a repo needs explicit adapters for checks, exports, or custom remote execution.

## Why this exists

- keeps adapter intent in the contract instead of hiding it in scripts
- gives humans a clear place to review repo-specific integration points
- gives agents structured context for the extra behavior around the core contract

## When to use it

- a repo needs a custom check or export adapter
- a repo wants a custom remote execution backend
- you want adapter boundaries to stay reviewable and explicit

## What this teaches

- how to keep `extensions` readable and stable
- how to separate repo contract, adapter contract, and task execution
- how to keep extension-powered behavior close to the repo it serves

## Folders

- `template/` - extension contract template
- `check-provider/repo-check/` - repo validation adapter example
- `export-provider/release-upload/` - release export adapter example
- `backend-provider/remote-shell-node-service/` - custom remote backend example

## Read first

1. `template/README.md`
2. `check-provider/repo-check/README.md`
3. `export-provider/release-upload/README.md`
4. `backend-provider/remote-shell-node-service/README.md`

## Rule

Keep adapter metadata in `ota.yaml` and keep the README at the use-case level.
